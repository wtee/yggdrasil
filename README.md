# Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is a a simple, responsive, light-weight (~2K minified), fluid (ooh)
and nestable (double ooh), mobile-first CSS grid in 12 parts.
(Basically, all the buzzwords.)

It's named after the [mythological Norse world tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil).
Also, a little, this [old Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil_Linux/GNU/X).
Why? Partially, because it sounds better than css-grid. Partially,
because a CSS grid is a "world tree" that holds the various elements of
a page together.

## But why make it?
Because I could.

## Should you use it?
Meh.

Yggdrasil's pretty young and still subject to change. Maybe use a more
mature grid system. There's a lot of nice options out there. That said,
it's super simple, so if that's your thing ...
