#Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is a simple responsive (and fluid ( ... ooh)), mobile-
first CSS grid in 12 parts. 

It's named after the [mythological Norseworld tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil). 
Also, a little, this [old Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil_Linux/GNU/X).
Why? Partially, because it sound's better than css-grid. Partially,
because a CSS grid is a "world tree" that holds the various elements of
a page together.

##But why make it?
Because I could.

##Should you use it?
Meh. 

Yggdrasil's pretty young and still subject to change. Maybe use a more 
mature grid system. There's a lot of nice options out there. That said,
it's supper simple, so if that's your thing ...
