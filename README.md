# Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is a a simple, responsive, light-weight (~2K minified), fluid (ooh)
and nestable (double ooh), mobile-first CSS grid in 12-part flexbox harmony.
(Basically, all the buzzwords.)

It's named after the [mythological Norse world tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil).
Also, a little, this [old Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil_Linux/GNU/X).
Why? Partially, because it sounds better than css-grid. Partially,
because a CSS grid is a "world tree" that holds the various elements of
a page together.

## But why make it?
Because I could.

## Should you use it?
Meh.

Yggdrasil doesn't support browsers that don't support flexbox without vendor prefixes,
like IE 10, though it should degrade gracefully enough. It's also closer to a hobby project 
than an attempt at a professional, production-ready framework, so there may be odd edge 
cases where it breaks down in funny ways.

That said, it is functional and simple to use. And it's free and unencumbered software 
released into the public domain under the terms of the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org).

Also, there's a [demo](http://www.sometimes-i.com/code/yggdrasil/demo.html).
